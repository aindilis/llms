Here's a summary of your task list:

1. Fix productivity_requirements.pl script: Add features to determine priority and urgency of recent tasks in a given to-do file. Enable a stop marker or specify the number of most recent tasks to jog memory.
2. Implement an integrated search function that searches all FLP source code areas (Prolog, MVC, templates, etc.) for specific keywords or terms.
3. Develop a nagging reminder system that repeatedly tries and gives up at a certain time to remind you of upcoming important dates or recurrences.
4. Update the FLC meal planner with new pest control domains and ensure the use of PDDL+ planners on them.
5. Improve debugging by configuring your system after boot-up, including throttling the video card.
6. Coordinate the development of a secondary meal planning/caloriesingle domain to merge with existing bottom-up planning code and run regression tests.
7. Refactor the PDDL meal planner code and make it more generic and easier to edit. Add to it daily-chores.
8. Investigate using a generative AI to take stock of situations and predict correct responses, similar to proof by exhaustion in chess.
9. Work on automatic inventory reordering, etc.
10. Develop a system for recording what was eaten.
11. Implement the PDDL planner for food inventory, merging it with the previous planner system.
12. Rehabiliate the existing codebase and potentially rewrite parts of it.
13. Work on the installer for FRDCSA, using marelle-type syntax.
14. Configure an automatic configuration management system that can handle isa relationships between objects.
15. Develop a 'whatIf' module to test different scenarios and their potential outcomes.
16. Use machine learning algorithms like GANs to generate realistic images or videos from text descriptions.
17. Work on AI for a month, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, chatbots, etc.
18. Read and analyze your to-do lists to prioritize and plan accordingly.
19. Modify the flp and free-life-planner.jason repo to fix any issues that may have occurred.
20. Autodetect misbehavior like a shell-run from Jason and modify the FLP script as needed.
21. Develop an expert system to determine when it is appropriate for individuals to distract each other, incorporating FLP's setMode stuff and creating a web interface.
22. Create a code autocomplete tool using Emacs and Miai.
23. Work on financial tasks, releasing the project, and setting up the installer.
24. Continue working on financial planning and decision support systems.

Remember to prioritize your tasks based on their importance, urgency, and impact. Regularly revisit this list and adjust as needed to maintain a productive workflow.',
